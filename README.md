# Clappify

Emphasis👏🏿with👏🏾clapping👏🏽is👏🏼for👏🏻everyone.

[Clappify](https://neganp.github.io/clappify/) is an inane webpage
that replaces normal text with text that has U+1F44F CLAPPING HANDS
SIGN 👏 instead of spaces (or tabs, or newlines).


# Building

Clappify is built with Elm, so if you want to build it yourself
you'll have to
[install elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html). Once
you've done that, clone the repository. You can use `elm-reactor` to
compile the code to HTML and see the output in your browser.

```shell
git clone ssh://git@github.com/neganp/clappify.git
cd clappify
elm-reactor
```

You can build a standalone html file with

```shell
elm-make src/Clappify.elm --output outputfile.html
```
